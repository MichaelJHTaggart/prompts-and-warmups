It makes it so that our local semver versions are held in place.

*Unexpected
?What is left-pad?
kik = npm took away from a guy. 
he unpublished, and when left-pad disappeared, it broke.

It was a super simple package, but it broke lots of code.

YELC = have the repository locally.

The developer was feeling disenfranchised. People were not bringing code over, so he pushed up new code that would maliciously break the machine.

? controversy ?
Console logs political information 

?npm audit?
What is the current state of the packages? npm audit will show you!


?What is npm doctor? 
Something is weird. They will try to fix things for you automatically.
